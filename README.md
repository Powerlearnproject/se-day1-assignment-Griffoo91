Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
I M P O R T A N C E
It plays a crucial role in the technology field by enabling of the creation of reliable, scalable, and innovative software solution that meets user needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i. Development of programming languages such as Fortran, C.
ii. Establishment of software engineering as a disciple in 1960.
iii. The advent of structured programming.
iv. The rise of agile methodology.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

i. Requirement - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement.
ii. Design - Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
iii. Implementation -Writing code and building the software according to the design specification.
iv. Testing - Conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
v. Deployment - Releasing the software to the user and customers.
vi. Maintenance - Providing ongoing supports, updates, and enhancement to the software after the deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i.   Comparison - Waterfall uses the Sequential approach with distinct phases(like requirement, design and implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile uses the Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
ii. Contrast - 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i. Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing the software solution.
ii. Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing the test plans.
iii. Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of the software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i. IDEs - Are important as they provide comprehesive tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes. Example: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse.
ii. VCS - Are important as they are tools that are used to track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Example: GIT, subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
C H A L L E N G E S
i. Requirement may change during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays.
ii. Pressure to deliver project software on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
S T R A T E G I E S 
i. Effective communications
ii. Agile methodologies.
iii. Prioritization of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i. Unit Testing - Testing individual component or modules of a system.
ii. Integration Testing - Testing different interaction between different components or subsystem.
iii. System Testing - Testing the whole system as a whole.
iv. Acceptance Testing - Testing the system against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is about crafting questions and instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from AI astistant.
I M P O R T A N C E 
Due its precise and clear organized way, it ensure the instructions are presented well so as to good response from the AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt.
Describe politics.

Improvement.
How is the game of politics, what is the character of those who involve themselves in politics.

Effectiveness.
The prompt not only describes politics, but also what to inquire the rules of the politics as a game and in detailed inquires the strategies and charaters of politicians.
